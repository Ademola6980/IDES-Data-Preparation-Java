{"name":"IDES Data Preparation - Java","tagline":"","body":"## IDES Data Preparation\r\nThe International Data Exchange Service (IDES) is a secure managed file transfer service that allows financial institutions and tax authorities to securely send information on financial accounts held by U.S. taxpayers in accordance with the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). Files transmitted via IDES must be encrypted and packaged in accordance with published data preparation instructions.  The data preparation process is an important step to ensure that information transmitted via IDES conforms to U.S security standards to safeguard sensitive information.\r\n\r\nThe IDES Data Preparation Java project repository demonstrates a sample working application built using Java inside of [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/).  An application was also developed using .Net, see [IDES Data Preparation .Net]  (http://irsgov.github.io/IDES-Data-Preparation-Dot-Net) for more information.\r\n\r\nThe example explains how to use the code to develop an application that will create an IDES data packet and decrypt notifications. The project starts with a validated FATCA XML file. The application does not validate the XML or metadata schemas. The sample application will digitally sign, encrypt, compress, and archive the data packet into a compliant .ZIP format.  \r\n\r\nPlease note that there are many open market tools that produce the same results; however, the IRS does not endorse any commercial products, including the frameworks used in the example.  \r\n\r\n### Application Setup\r\n\r\nThe sample application was created using Eclipse 4.4.1 and JRE version 1.8.0_40. \r\n\r\nThis repository includes a .zip file that contains several files necessary to this sample application. While some files can be copied and pasted from this guide, some must be downloaded from the .zip file and placed as indicated by the guide.\r\n\r\nKeystore - This folder contains a set of .jks files containing self-signed test public and private keys used by the application.\r\n\r\nlib - This folder contains the log4j-1.2.16.jar file which provides the console logging for the application.\r\n\r\ngenerated - This folder has a set of .java files related to the metadata used by the application.\r\n\r\nsrc - This folder has the main set of .java files, including testmain.java which is used to start the application.\r\n### Create a New Project  \r\n\r\n000000.00000.TA.124_0_Payload.xml - This is the FATCA XML that will be signed, encrypted, and packaged by the application. This is a test file for the application and is not intended to portray a specific business case.\r\n\r\n![Image 1](http://irsgov.github.io/IDES-Data-Preparation-Java/images/image1.png)  \r\nFigure 1   \r\n\r\n \r\nOpen **Eclipse**, select **New**, select **Java Project**.   \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
