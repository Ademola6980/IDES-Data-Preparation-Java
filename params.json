{"name":"IDES Data Preparation - Java","tagline":"","body":"## IDES Data Preparation\r\nThe International Data Exchange Service (IDES) is a secure managed file transfer service that allows financial institutions and tax authorities to securely send information on financial accounts held by U.S. taxpayers in accordance with the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). Files transmitted via IDES must be encrypted and packaged in accordance with published data preparation instructions.  The data preparation process is an important step to ensure that information transmitted via IDES conforms to U.S security standards to safeguard sensitive information.\r\n\r\nThe IDES Data Preparation Java project repository demonstrates a sample working application built using Java inside of [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/).  An application was also developed using .Net, see [IDES Data Preparation .Net]  (http://irsgov.github.io/IDES-Data-Preparation-Dot-Net) for more information.\r\n\r\nThe example explains how to use the code to develop an application that will create an IDES data packet and decrypt notifications. The project starts with a validated FATCA XML file. The application does not validate the XML or metadata schemas. The sample application will digitally sign, encrypt, compress, and archive the data packet into a compliant .ZIP format.  \r\n\r\nPlease note that there are many open market tools that produce the same results; however, the IRS does not endorse any commercial products, including the frameworks used in the example.  \r\n\r\n### Create a New Project  \r\n\r\n\r\n![Image 1](http://irsgov.github.io/IDES-Data-Preparation-Java/images/img1.png)  \r\nFigure 1   \r\n\r\n \r\nOpen **Eclipse**, select **New**, select **Java Project**.   \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
